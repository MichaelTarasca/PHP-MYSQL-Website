# PHP MYSQL Website
 
 
 ### Purpose
 
 This project was a way for me to learn how to code in PHP. Also a way for my father to keep track of the hundreds of DVD's he has. 
 
 ### The Project
 
 A simple movie website that accomplishes CRUD operations on a database. Users can select 1 of the 4 buttons at the top of the page to choose how they want to interact with the database. The database stores information about the movie (name, actor, director, genre) as well as the location it is located within my house.
 
 ### What I learned
 
 - Basic CRUD operations using PHP functions.
 - How to create a MSQL database and tables using PHP.
 - How to sanitize user input to ensure its not possible to inject html or SQL code.
 
 ### Future Changes 
 
 - Create second page to separate movies from shows.
 - Login functionality with password hashing.
 - Better styling and layout of information.

 ### Changelog
 
 - 03/01/2021: Changed from mysqli statements to prepared PDO statements. 
 - 02/28/2021: Cleaned up main page styling.
